## Hi there 👋
Welcome to The CitizenFX Archives, hosted by Project Fairness Labs.
In here, we have archives of the repos of The CitizenFX collective. 
After their announcement in regards to the Terms of Service, we decided to create an organization should they privatize their repos.
<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
